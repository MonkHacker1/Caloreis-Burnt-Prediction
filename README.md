#  Caloreis-Burnt-Prediction
Calories Burnt Prediction is a machine learning project that originated as a Kaggle competition. The competition was designed to develop a predictive model that could accurately estimate the number of calories burnt during physical activity based on various features such as heart rate, body temperature, and physical activity type.

After the competition ended, the project was made available as an open source codebase on GitHub. This allows developers to continue working on the project, improving the accuracy of the model, and experimenting with different feature engineering and modeling techniques.

The GitHub repository contains all the necessary files to get started with the project, including the original dataset, sample code, and Jupyter notebooks. The project is organized in a clear and concise manner, making it easy for developers to navigate through the code and understand the logic behind each step.

The project is a valuable resource for developers who want to improve their machine learning skills, as it provides a real-world dataset and a well-defined problem to solve. By working on the project, developers can gain experience in data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, they can contribute to the project by submitting their own models and improving the performance of the model on the test set.

Overall, Calorie Burnt Prediction is a great project for anyone interested in health and fitness, machine learning, and data science. The project offers a challenging problem, a well-defined dataset, and a supportive community that is willing to help newcomers get started with the project. It provides an opportunity for developers to test their machine learning skills and contribute to the improvement of the model.
